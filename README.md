# Boids - artificial life program algorithm project writen in java.

## Simulates realistic flocking behavior using simple adjustable rules:

Separation: Boids avoid crowding neighbors.

Alignment: Boids align their velocity with nearby flockmates.

Cohesion: Boids steer towards the average position of nearby flockmates.

## Features:
Smooth, real-time animation of boid movements.

Adjustable parameters for speed, perception, and separation distance.

Scalable to large numbers of boids for observing emergent flock patterns.
